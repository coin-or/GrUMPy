# GrUMPy 0.85

[![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/18217673.svg)](https://zenodo.org/badge/latestdoi/18217673)

Graphics for Understanding Mathematical Programming in Python (GrUMPy) is a
Python library for visualizing various aspects of mathematical programming,
including visualizations of the branch-and process, branch-and-bound trees,
polyhedra, cutting plane methods, etc. The goal is clarity in implementation
rather than efficiency. Most methods have an accompanying visualization and are
thus appropriate for use in the classroom.

Documentation for the API is here:

Pypi download page is here:

https://pypi.python.org/pypi/coinor.grumpy

See below for brief documentation of usage

## Installation Notes

To install, do:

```
easy_install coinor.grumpy
```
or
```
pip install coinor.grumpy
```

1. GrUMPy depends on [GiMPy](https://github.com/coin-or/GiMPy), which will be automatically installed as part of the setup. However, in order for GiMPy to visualize the branch-and-bound tree, it's necessary to install [GraphViz](http://www.graphviz.org) and choose one of these additional methods for display:
  * Recommended: [xdot 0.6](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/xdot). 
    * Install with `pip install xdot==0.6`
    * Call `set_display_mode('xdot')`
  Note that xdot 0.6 depends on [PyGtk](http://www.pygtk.org/) (see below for platform-specific installation instructions for installing). 
  * [Python Imaging Library](http://www.pythonware.com/products/pil/) and call `set_display_mode('PIL')`
  * [Pygame](pygame.org) and call `set_display_mode('pygame')`
  * Call `set_display_mode('file')` to just write files to disk that have to then be opened manually. 
  
  It is also possible to typeset labels in LaTex and to output the graph in LaTex format using `dot2tex` (**Warning**: recent versions of `dot2tex` have not perfectly, your mileage may vary). After installing `dot2tex`, this can be done by simply calling the method `write(basename='fileName', format='dot')`, and then doing `dot2tex --tmath fileName.dot` or by calling `set_display_mode('dot2tex')` and then `display()` as usual. At the moment, the latter only seems to work with version `2.9.0dev` available [here](https://github.com/Alwnikrotikz/dot2tex). For the former method, just using `easy_install dot2tex` should work fine.
1. GrUMPy also creates some visualizations with [gnuplot](https://sourceforge.net/projects/gnuplot/). For tips on installing `gnuplot`, see below.
1. GrUMPy can also visualize 2D polyhedra with the installation of [pypolyhedron](https://github.com/rdeits/pypolyhedron), which must be installed from source.
  
# Additional Notes for Windows Installation

  * To install Graphviz, download the installer [here](http://www.graphviz.org/Download.php). **Important**: after installing, you must manually add the graphviz `bin` directory (usually `C:\Program Files (x86)\Graphviz2.38\bin`) to your `PATH` 
  * If you want to use `xdot`, there are some more requirements: 
     * Unfortunately, you must have a 32-bit version of Python 2.7
     * You must install the [PyGtk version 2.22.6](http://ftp.gnome.org/pub/GNOME/binaries/win32/pygtk/2.22/pygtk-all-in-one-2.22.6.win32-py2.7.msi). Version 2.24 is buggy on Windows.
     * To install `gnuplot`, download the installer [here](https://sourceforge.net/projects/gnuplot/). Note that the CYGWIN version of gnuplot may not work when called from Python.  

# Additional Notes for Linux Installation

  * Graphviz can be installed as a package on most Linux distros, e.g., `sudo apt-get install graphviz`
  * To use `xdot`, you need to install PyGtk. On Debian/Ubuntu, do `sudo apt-get install python-gtk2` 
  * Gnuplot should be available for installation with your favorite package manager.
  
# Additional Notes for OS X Users

  * The situation with Python on OS X is a bit of a mess. It is recommended to install python using [homebrew](http://brew.sh) with `brew install python`).
  * With homebbrew, one can also easily install graphviz (`brew install graphviz`), PyGtk (`brew install pygtk`), and gnuplot (`brew install gnuplot`) 

There have been reports of incompatibilities with recent versions of PyGtk, but I have not attempted yet to track this down. If things break, you may try some variant of the instructions above for installing on Windows.

## Usage

### Visualizing Branch and Bound Trees

There are two separate modes for visualizing branch and bound trees. One uses
[GiMPy](https://github.com/coin-or/GiMPy) to visualize the tree (which in turn
uses [GraphViz](http://www.graphviz.org) for layout). The other is to use the
visualizations from the now-defunct Branch and Bound Analysis Kit (BAK), which
was merged with GrUMPy. With the methods of the former BAK, one can visualize
the tree in a number of ways using the venerated `gnuplot` (see a paper about
it [here](http://coral.ie.lehigh.edu/~ted/files/papers/BBVis.pdf)).

The tree object itself can also be constructed in two different ways. The
first is using the API of the `BBTree` class, as follows.

```python
from coinor.grumpy import BBTree

T = BBTree()

#These can be any node attributes recognized by GraphViz
attr = {'color':'red',
        'style':'filled',
        'fillcolor':'red',
        'label':id}

T.AddOrUpdateNode(id = 0, parent_id = None,
                  branch_direction = None,
                  status = 'branched',
                  lp_bound = 100.2,
                  integer_infeasibility_count = 10,
                  integer_infeasibility_sum = 1.5,
                  condition_begin = None,
                  condition_end = None,
                  attr)
```

The properties of a node that are needed to visualize the tree with BAK are

 * `id`: The index of the node (or another unique id)
 * `parent_id`: The id of the parent node
 * `branch_direction`: For nodes other than the root node, this indicates
 which child (left or right) the node is of the parent. There is a somewhat
 arbitrary convention that when branching on variable disjunctions, the left
 branch is the one in which the variable's upper bond is reduced and the right
 branch is the one in which the variable's lower bound is increased.
 * `status`: The status of the node in the solution process. Can be one of
   * `candidate`: The node is a leaf node in the current (incomplete) tree.
   * `pregnant`: The node has been processed, but has not yet been branched.
   * `branched`: The node has been branched and is now an internal node.
   * `infeasible`: The node was found infeasible.
   * `fathomed`: The node was fathomed by bound.
   * `integer`: Solving the relaxation resulted in an integer solution
 * `lp_bound`: Bound obtained by solving the relaxation associated with the
 node.
 * `integer_infeasibility_count`: The number of variables that are fractional
 in the solution to the relaxation.
 * `integer_infeasibility_sum`: The total sum of the fractional parts of the
 values of the variables.
 * `condition_begin`: The condition number of the optimal basis for the initial
 LP relaxation in the node.
 * `condition_end`: The condition number of the optimal basis for the final
 LP relaxation in the node (after possibly adding cuts).

The properties related to condition number are optional and utilized only if
present. For visualizing the tree with GiMPy, only the `id` and `parent_id`
are required (in the future, this may change).

The second way of constructing the tree is by parsing a log file from a
solver. Any solver can be instrumented to generate a file that can then be
used to visualize the tree and this can even be done "live" (subject to the
speed at which the visualizations can be generated). The log file must contain
one line for each event type. The events are primarily those that either
create or change the status of nodes and in fact, the valid event types are
exactly those listed above as valid node statuses with one addition: there is
also an event called `heuristic` corresponding to the generation of a new
solution found by a heuristic. The `heuristic` event is the only one that does
not change the status of any node, just the global bound.

Each line of the log file consists of a space-separated list of fields. The
fields are as follows:

 1. Time stamp.
 2. Event type (one of the statuses listed above or `heuristic`.
 3. The id of the node being created or changing status.
 4. The id of the node's parent.
 5. The branch direction (`R` or `L`).

The remaining fields differ by event type.

 * `heuristic`: Field 6 is the bjective value of the solution.
 * `infeasible`: Fields 6-7 are the beginning and ending conditions numbers
 (optional).
 * `branched`: Field 6 is the LP bound, fields 7-8 are the integer
 infeasibility count and the sum of integer infeasibilities, fields 9-10 are
 the beginning and ending conditions numbers (optional).
 * `candidate`: Field 6 is the LP bound
 * `pregnant`: Field 6 is the LP bound, fields 7-8 are
 the beginning and ending conditions numbers (optional). Pregnant status
 lines are entirely optional.
 * `integer`: Field 6 is the value of the solution (LP bound), fields 9-10 are
 the beginning and ending conditions numbers (optional).
 * `fathomed`: No additional fields

A snippet from an example file might look as follows (see, e.g.,  [p0201_SYMPHONY.vbc](https://github.com/coin-or/GrUMPy/blob/master/src/grumpy/examples/p0201_SYMPHONY.vbc):
```

```

The file can be processed as follows (see, e.g., [BBVis.py](https://github.com/coin-or/GrUMPy/blob/master/src/grumpy/examples/BBVis.py):

```python
from coinor.grumpy import BBTree

bt = BBTree()
file = open('vbc.out', 'r')
for line in file:
    bt.ProcessLine(line)
```

To display the visualizations, do

```python
import sys
import StringIO
from PIL import Image as PIL_Image

#BAK-style visualizations

#gnuplot_image = StringIO.StringIO(bt.GenerateHistogram()
gnuplot_image = StringIO.StringIO(bt.GenerateTreeImage())
#gnuplot_image = StringIO.StringIO(bt.GenerateScatterplot()
#gnuplot_image = StringIO.StringIO(bt.GenerateIncumbentPath()
#gnuplot_image = StringIO.StringIO(bt.GenerateForecastImages()
im = PIL_Image.open(gnuplot_image)
im.show()

#GiMPy visualization (GraphViz)

bt.set_display_mode('xdot')
bt.display()
```

## Visualizing Polyhedra

GrUMPy can be used to visualize polyhedra in two dimenions using the module polyhedron (see, e.g., [DisplayPolyhedronAndSolveLP.py](https://github.com/coin-or/GrUMPy/blob/master/src/grumpy/examples/DisplayPolyhedronAndSolveLP.py))

```python
from coinor.grumpy.polyhedron2D import Polyhedron2D, Figure
points = [[2.5, 4.5], [6.5, 0.5], [0.5, 1],
          [7, 5.7], [7.7, 5], [2, 0.25]]
rays = []
c = [2, 5]
opt = [7, 5.7]
loc = (opt[0]+0.1, opt[1]-0.1)
obj_val = 42.5

p = Polyhedron2D(points = points, rays = rays)
f = Figure()
f.add_polyhedron(p, label = 'Polyhedron $P$', color = 'red')
f.set_xlim([p.xlim[0], p.xlim[1]+1])
f.set_ylim([p.ylim[0], p.ylim[1]+2])
f.add_line(c, obj_val, p.xlim + [0.2, 0.8], p.ylim + [0.2, 1.8], 
           linestyle = 'dashed', color = 'black', label = "Objective Function")
f.add_point(opt, 0.04, 'red')
f.add_text(loc, r'$x^* = %s$' % str(opt))
f.show()
```
