GrUMPy 1.0
==========

Graphics for Understanding Mathematical Programming in Python (GrUMPy) is a
Python library for visualizing various aspects of mathematical programming,
including visualizations of the branch-and process, branch-and-bound trees,
polyhedra, cutting plane methods, etc. The goal is clarity in implementation
rather than eficiency. Most methods have an accompanying visualization and are
thus appropriate for use in the classroom.
